CS-465 Full Stack Development with MEAN

Architecture
The challenge with front-end development is that the tools and methods used to create a website's front end are always changing, requiring the developer to have a constant understanding of how the field is changing. Express is a compact framework that augments Node.js' built-in web server functionality to simplify the usage of existing APIs and add practical new features. It's simple to organize your project's functionality using middleware and routing. The most popular computer language for building web pages on the Internet is called HTML, or Hyper Text Markup Language. It is extremely easy to utilize JavaScript, an interpreted, lightweight programming language. It is cross-platform and available for free. A single page contains a single-page application (SPA) with a large amount of data that remains constant and just a little amount that has to be altered all at once.


Functionality
JSON is a way of formatting object data that can be easily read by JavaScript and converted into literal JavaScript objects. This makes it easier for javascript to take data and shape it into javascript language objects. This ties frontend and backend development together as it provides a way to store data/javascript objects in the backend and use them in different situations depending on what the frontend is requesting the data for. increase. This also means that the data can be stored once and accessed and used in many ways. An example of code refactoring to improve functionality and efficiency is the use of Trip Card and Trip List components. Having two separate components rendering the same information is inefficient, but the overall functionality of the site works better if each ride is rendered separately but still part of the whole.

Testing
There are several ways to test endpoints before adding protection. The first is  to open the localhost web address of the API endpoint to see if the page successfully loads the data or what  error it throws when an error occurs. But an application like Postman that tests HTTP requests  is ideal  because it can also implement security measures and flows to test endpoints that might be protected against unauthenticated users.

How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?
I have always had the goal to learn full stack development even though I knew I did not want to pursue it as a career. One thing I am confident in from taking this course is learning the ins and outs of SPAs. This will be useful to me as I am a creator and do look into this.
